 Introduction
The IEEE 802.3 and 802.5 LANs, discussed in the previous sections, having data transfer
rate in the range of 10 Mb/s to 16 Mb/s have served the purpose very well for many
years. But with the availability of powerful computers at a low cost and emergence of
new applications, particularly based on multimedia, there is a growing demand for higher
network bandwidth. The combined effect of the growth in the number of users and
increasing bandwidth requirement per user has led to the development of High Speed
LANs with data transfer rate of 100 Mb/s or more.
