 Introduction
The IEEE 802.3 and 802.5 LANs, discussed in the previous sections, having data transfer
rate in the range of 10 Mb/s to 16 Mb/s have served the purpose very well for many
years. But with the availability of powerful computers at a low cost and emergence of
new applications, particularly based on multimedia, there is a growing demand for higher
network bandwidth. The combined effect of the growth in the number of users and
increasing bandwidth requirement per user has led to the development of High Speed
LANs with data transfer rate of 100 Mb/s or more.
Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI), developed by American National Standards
Institute (ANSI) is a token passing ring network that operates at 100 Mb/s on optical
fiber-medium. Its medium access control approach has close similarity with the IEEE
802.5 standard, but certain features have been added to it for higher reliability and better
performance. Key features of FDDI are outlined in this section
The FDDI standard divides transmission functions into 4 protocols: physical
medium dependent (PMD), Physical (PHY), media access control(MAC) and Logical
link control(LLC) as shown in Fig. 5.5.1. These protocols correspond to the physical and
data link layer of OSI reference model. Apart from these four protocols, one more
protocol which span across both data link and physical layer (if considered of OSI), used
for the station management.
